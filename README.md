# Bayesian-Hyperparameter-Optimization-of-LSTM-for-SOC
This project focuses on estimating the state of charge (SOC) using a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network. The SOC estimation is a critical aspect of battery management systems and plays a crucial role in optimizing battery performance and lifespan.
